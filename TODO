TODO
----

- May need to create PKI file
- Need to auth minion to master

- Initially populate srv with a few salt states
- get git mounts working too

ISSUES
------
- minion gitfs does not seem to work well with salt-call
  - search gitfs minion salt-call
    - google
    - google groups
- can't seem to locate gitfs in /srv/formulas for inrospection

GITFS
-----
- We can just end up writing own gitfs to grab; update and verify and store in /srv/salt

GPG
---
- need to be able to sign git commits;
- need to be able to push key for others
- one state will grab stuff from my repo; need to verify tag as well though


SALT-MASTER
-----------
- Once bootstrapped, get salt server to grab git repo to install EVERYTHING else we want
  so we will need to create some type of install state which will include salt server states
  so it can update itself
- during this installation; add packages to top.sls, but commented out

HALITE
------
- halite will also be included
- halite can either read top.sls or walk the salt base to be able to provide GUI to enable/disable states

QUBES-RPC
---------
- create a master AppVM that communicates via RPC and have master have no networking by default; except to update

NOTES
-----
- autoaccept is on (localhost only); turn off after initial update
